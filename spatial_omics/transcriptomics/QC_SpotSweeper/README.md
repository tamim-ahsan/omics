I have performed **QC** analysis on spatial transcriptomic datasets from various platforms using the **SpotSweeper** bioconductor package.\
This is the first package to perform *spatially aware* QC analysis of spatial transcriptomci data. The original paper can be accessed [here](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-025-02713-3). \
So far, I have analyzed the following datasets 
| Platform | Species | Tissue | Source | 
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 10x Visium (V1) | Human | DLPFC | STexampleData |
| Slide-Seq V2 | Mouse | Hippocampus | STexampleData |
| Stereo-seq | Human | PFC | STOmicsDB |

I will soon analyze **Visium HD** and **Xenium** datasets. Stay tuned!\
