***Contents of the folder***\
This folder contains codes for various types of **integrative analysis** using **multimodal** data. So far I have performed - 
- **Multiomics pathway enrichment analysis:** For this analysis, the omics layers can be analyzed separately. The results from different layers can then be *"combined"* together to get an integrated view of which pathways are being impacted by a biological condition of interest.
