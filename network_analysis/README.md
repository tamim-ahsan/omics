***Contents of the folder***\
This folder contains codes for various types of network anlayses to gain biological insights from omics data.\
So, far I have done - 
- **Weighted gene coexpression network anlaysis:** It moves beyond the differential expression analysis and tries to find sets of genes that are coexpressed under certain biological conditions. By weighting the coexpression value it tries to get rid of weak correlations.
